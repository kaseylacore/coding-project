                    <p>Foursquare is the leading cloud-based location platform for understanding people, places, and the interactions between them. This project was a branding refresh and redesign of the front-end of their website. I worked on this project during my role as a Visual Designer at Ruckus Marketing.</p>
                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Foursquare was happy with the overall flow and architecture of their website, but felt that their site didn't portray them as a location technology provider. They were also concerned about the lack of consistency and cohesion. The challenge was to expand on Foursquare's existing branding to create a new, clean website design that clearly portrays the brand as a location technology provider.</p>
                    <h2>My Role</h2>
                    <p>Lead Visual Designer</p>

                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <div><!--start section for version 1-->
                    <p>With Foursquare's brand guidelines as a jumping off point, I started brainstorming new imagery concepts, illustration treatments and brand extension pieces around the theme of location technology. I presented the client with two new homepage redesigns with our new ideas.</p>
                <div><!--start row for columns-->
                    <div><!--start column 1-->
                        <h3>Option 1</h3>
                        <p> Foursquare's original site had many different illustration styles that contributed to a lack of cohesion - there were line drawings, isometric map images and 3D models, and more. I pitched this new 3D map as the main hero style because it lent itself to animation effects and very obviously hit on the theme of location. </p>

                    <div><!--start column 2-->
                        <h3>Option 2</h3>
                        <p>I showed the client a second hero layout with a looping animation of images. My team felt like the old site was missing a human element, and using photography of people moving through distinct environments was a way to make the photography more “ownable” than using stock imagery of people on their phones or computers, like many tech companies.   </p>

                <div>
                    <p>Version 1 client feedback: The Foursquare team didn't feel like the 3D map was distinctive enough and thought the photography selection was too “cute.” They pushed us to think about the themes of tools, building blocks, place and movement, and to come back with more “ownable” branding elements.</p>

            <div><!--start section for version 2-->
                <p> Essentially tossing the first two ideas, I was back to the drawing board. Fortunately, my teammate, Tyler Troup, had some extra bandwidth to help out. Foursquare told us about a new technology they were launching called Hex Tiles - a proprietary new analytic tile system using a hexagon grid. They tossed out the using a hexagon as branding element, which we ran with. We came up with these two these two options:</p>
                <div><!--start row for columns-->
                    <div><!--start column 1-->
                        <h3>Option 1</h3>
                        <p>We introduced a layered photography treatment that creates a unique look, but also communicates a few different brand touchpoints at once. We used the code snippet to represent this idea of “tool” or “building block,” as code is the building block for developers. We included a device mockup with a product shot to enforce the idea of location technology. And finally, we included an image of a person making a purchase to illustrating that Foursquare’s products are tied to a commercial exchange. We also introduced this idea of a “Hex Path.” A line creates an animated path down the page, with a hexagon creating a stopping point at different points of interest.</p>

                    <div><!--start column 2-->
                        <h3>Option 2</h3>
                        <p>We used a large hexagon shape as a background element, layered with a small honey-comb like Hex Tiles. Foursquare had given us a few examples sites where design was used to guide the users eye down the page, so he used the hexagon background to achieve that. We also introduced layering the mint POI Beacon as a photography treatment. </p>

                <div>
                    <p>Version 2 client feedback: The photo layering treatment and Hex Path animation were very well received, so Foursquare wanted to use Option 1 as a base. They suggested that we incorporate the POI beacons from Option 2, and explore different ways to use the hexagon as a background or photo mask. </p>

            <div><!--start section for version 3-->
                <h2>Final version</h2>
                <p>Before coming up with Version 3, I met with Foursquare's developers to discuss the Hex Path animation. They pointed out that we needed modular components and patterns, and that the animation covering the entire page would make that impossible. So for Version 3 we contained each Hex Path with a single module that could be reused as needed. I also addressed the basics. One of the issues in Foursquare's old site was the lack of visual contrast in the typography, so I updated the type system to include more variability in font weights to create a stronger visual hierarchy for increased scannability. I also created a consistent CTA design and padding system. Version 3 made use of the liked elements from Option 1 and 2 in a modular design format, and earned approval from the client.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>After finally earning homepage approval, I worked with the team to apply the design to the entire site, which was 25+ screens. The Foursquare team was very pleased with the end result, and ended up contracting my company for more work - which is a win in my book. </p>
